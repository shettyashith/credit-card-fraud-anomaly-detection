# Credit Card Transaction Fraud Anomaly Detection

This project implements an unsupervised anomaly detection approach to identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions using Isolation Forest.

## Approach
- Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
- Model: Isolation Forest
- Metric: Precision

## Dataset
A public anonymized credit card transaction dataset was used.  
A subset of 7,973 transactions was selected for faster experimentation.

## Results
- Total transactions analyzed: 7,973
- Anomalous transactions detected: 80
- Precision score: ~0.29
